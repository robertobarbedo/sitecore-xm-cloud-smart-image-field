# Admin-Only Migration Summary

## Overview
This project has been converted from a full Sitecore Marketplace extension (including field components) to an **admin-only** version. All field-related functionality has been removed, keeping only the administrative interface.

## What Was Removed

### Components
- `ImageSelector.tsx` - Field component for selecting/uploading images
- `ImageFind.tsx` - Field component for searching existing images
- `ImageMetadata.tsx` - Field component for managing image metadata
- `ImageCropping.tsx` - Field component for image cropping and focal points
- `ItemInfo.tsx` - Helper component for displaying item information
- `RecommendedInfoPanel.tsx` - Field component for AI recommendations
- `AppContext.tsx` - Context component that depended on removed hooks

### API Routes
- `/api/analyze-image` - Image analysis endpoint for AI features
- `/api/proxy-image` - Image proxy endpoint
- `/api/upload` - Image upload endpoint

### Utilities & Hooks
- `useMarketplaceClient.ts` - Hook for Marketplace SDK client
- `useMarketplaceClientWithPostMedia.disabled` - Alternative client hook
- Entire `/src/utils` directory removed

### Libraries
- `folder-manager.ts` - Sitecore folder management utilities
- `/src/lib/openai` - OpenAI integration for image analysis

### Documentation
- `FOCUS_POINT_FEATURE.md` - Focus point feature documentation
- `IMAGE_DIMENSIONS_FEATURE.md` - Image dimensions feature documentation
- `IMAGE_RECOMMENDATIONS_FEATURE.md` - AI recommendations documentation
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Field-specific troubleshooting guide
- `IMAGE_FIND_README.md` - Image search documentation

### Dependencies
Removed from `package.json`:
- `@sitecore-marketplace-sdk/client` (field SDK)
- `cropperjs` and `@types/cropperjs` (image cropping)

## What Was Kept

### Admin Interface
- `/src/app/admin/*` - Complete admin panel and components
- Admin-specific documentation files
- Library management functionality
- URL generation tools
- Folder validation utilities

### Core Infrastructure
- `/database/*` - Database schema and migrations
- `/src/lib/config.ts` - Configuration management
- `/src/lib/supabase-client.ts` - Supabase client (used by admin)
- Layout and routing structure

### Dependencies
Kept in `package.json`:
- `@sitecore-marketplace-sdk/xmc` (admin SDK)
- `@supabase/supabase-js` (database access)
- Next.js, React, TypeScript

## Changes Made

### Main Page (`src/app/page.tsx`)
Changed from full field extension UI to a simple redirect to `/admin`:
```tsx
export default function Home() {
  const router = useRouter();
  useEffect(() => {
    router.push('/admin');
  }, [router]);
  return <div>Redirecting to admin...</div>;
}
```

### Package Name
Updated package name from `xmcloud-extension-starter` to `xmcloud-smart-control-admin`.

### README.md
Completely rewritten to reflect admin-only focus with updated documentation and getting started guide.

## Next Steps

1. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` to update dependencies based on the new `package.json`
2. **Set up environment**: Configure your `.env.local` file with Supabase credentials
3. **Run the app**: Use `npm run dev` and navigate to `/admin`
4. **Verify functionality**: Test the admin panel to ensure all features work as expected

## File Structure After Migration

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── admin/              # Admin interface (kept)
│   ├── layout.tsx          # Root layout
│   └── page.tsx            # Root page (redirects to /admin)
└── lib/
    ├── config.ts           # Config utilities
    └── supabase-client.ts  # Supabase client
```

All field-related code and dependencies have been successfully removed while preserving the complete admin functionality.
