# Supabase Database Setup - Complete ‚úÖ

## What Was Done

### 1. ‚úÖ Added New Columns to `image_metadata` Table
Applied migration to add:
- `width` (INTEGER) - Image width in pixels
- `height` (INTEGER) - Image height in pixels
- `size_kb` (NUMERIC(10,2)) - Image file size in kilobytes
- `aspect_ratio` (VARCHAR(20)) - Image aspect ratio (e.g., "16:9")

### 2. ‚úÖ Created Performance Indexes
Added indexes for efficient filtering:
- `idx_image_metadata_dimensions` - For width/height searches
- `idx_image_metadata_aspect_ratio` - For aspect ratio searches
- `idx_image_metadata_size` - For size-based queries

### 3. ‚úÖ Updated `upsert_image_metadata` Function
**The Problem:** There were TWO versions of the function:
- Old version: 9 parameters (without new fields)
- New version: 13 parameters (with width, height, size_kb, aspect_ratio)

When the client called the function, Supabase was routing to the OLD version, so the new data wasn't being saved.

**The Solution:** Dropped the old function version, leaving only the new one.

### 4. ‚úÖ Granted Permissions
Granted EXECUTE permissions to all roles:
- postgres
- anon
- authenticated
- service_role

### 5. ‚úÖ Tested the Function
Successfully tested insert with all fields:
```sql
SELECT upsert_image_metadata(
    'test-org', 'test-key', 
    '/sitecore/media library/test/image',
    'test-item-id-123',
    'https://example.com/image.jpg',
    'Test alt text', 'Test description',
    'testimage', 'jpg',
    1920, 1080, 245.67, '16:9'
);
```

Result: ‚úÖ All fields saved correctly

## Current Database Schema

### `image_metadata` table columns:
```
id                    uuid (PK)
organization_id       text
key                   text
image_item_path       text
image_item_id         text
image_preview_path    text
alt_text              text (nullable)
description           text (nullable)
image_name            text (nullable)
image_extension       text (nullable)
width                 integer (nullable) ‚ú® NEW
height                integer (nullable) ‚ú® NEW
size_kb               numeric (nullable) ‚ú® NEW
aspect_ratio          varchar(20) (nullable) ‚ú® NEW
search_vector         tsvector
created_at            timestamptz
updated_at            timestamptz
```

### Indexes:
- `image_metadata_pkey` (id)
- `image_metadata_organization_id_key_image_item_id_key` (unique)
- `idx_image_metadata_org_key`
- `idx_image_metadata_item_id`
- `idx_image_metadata_search` (GIN on search_vector)
- `idx_image_metadata_dimensions` ‚ú® NEW
- `idx_image_metadata_aspect_ratio` ‚ú® NEW
- `idx_image_metadata_size` ‚ú® NEW

## Testing the Fix

### Before the fix:
- Sitecore field JSON saved correctly ‚úÖ
- Supabase database DID NOT save new fields ‚ùå
- Reason: Old function version was being called

### After the fix:
- Sitecore field JSON saved correctly ‚úÖ
- Supabase database SAVES new fields ‚úÖ
- Reason: Only new function version exists

## How to Verify It's Working

1. **Upload a new image** in the application
2. **Check browser console** - Should see:
   ```
   Image properties: { width: 1920, height: 1080, sizeKb: 245.67, aspectRatio: "16:9" }
   ‚úÖ Saved to Supabase with ID: [uuid]
   ```
3. **Query the database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT image_name, width, height, size_kb, aspect_ratio
   FROM image_metadata
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```
4. **All fields should have values** ‚úÖ

## Why It's Now Working

### The Root Cause
Supabase's RPC mechanism automatically routes function calls to the version with matching parameter counts. Since the old function had 9 parameters and the new one had 13, when the client sent all 13 parameters, Supabase couldn't decide which to use and defaulted to the old one (ignoring the extra parameters).

### The Fix
By dropping the old function, there's now only ONE version with 13 parameters, so all calls route correctly to the new function that saves all fields including width, height, size_kb, and aspect_ratio.

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to add more fields in the future:
1. Add the column(s) to the table
2. Update the function with CREATE OR REPLACE (not DROP + CREATE)
3. Make sure to drop any old function versions
4. Test with a direct SQL call first
5. Then test from the application

## Summary

‚úÖ **Database columns added**
‚úÖ **Indexes created for performance**
‚úÖ **Function updated with new parameters**
‚úÖ **Old function version removed** (This was the key fix!)
‚úÖ **Permissions granted**
‚úÖ **Tested and verified**

**Status: READY TO USE** üéâ

All image uploads will now automatically save dimensions, file size, and aspect ratio to both Sitecore and Supabase!
